    <h1>Merry Christmas, Riccardo!</h1>
    
    <p>I know you as someone very brainy who loves a puzzle. This is why I programmed a little "puzzle-game" as a present for you -
      <b>the N-queens game!</b></p>
    
    <p>The game is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle">8-Queens Problem</a> and
      the challenge is to place N queens on an N x N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
      Note that every time you place a queen on the chessboard, a solver checks if there is a solution for the current placement,
      that's why there is a minimal delay after each step.
      Sorry for the simple graphics, that's not my strength ;-)</p>

  
    <p>I will keep this game online for a couple of days. If you would like to play the game locally on your machine, then write a
      message in the secret santa channel and I'll share the code with you including setup instructions (it's mainly written in
      Python using Flask).</p>
    <br>
    
    <form method="POST">
      <b>Start playing:</b> choose your chessboard size (N): <input name="N" maxlength="3" size="3" type ="number" style="width: 50px;">
      <br>(<i>hint: 5 is a good start</i>)
       <p><input type="submit" value="Play!"></p>
